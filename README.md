# Download ID Field

This is a custom Form Field to help Joomla! extension developers to implement Joomla Update System and meet the new [JED requirement](https://extensions.joomla.org/support/knowledgebase/item/joomla-update-system-requirement/ "Joomla! Update System requirement") for **PAID** extensions.

This field is developed to be used with [Akeeba Subscriptions](https://github.com/akeeba/akeebasubs/wiki) and [Akeeba Release System](https://github.com/akeeba/release-system/wiki) packages, although it can be customized to work with other subscriptions and realease/downlaod managers.

## How To Use?

First of all, download the downloadid.php file and add it in a proper folder inside your extension package I recommend assets/fields, so the the relative path should be YOUR\_EXTENSION/assets/fields/downloadid.php

Now, the Download ID field is ready to be used as any other standard form field within your installation xml file.

This is an example of parts of a module installation file, let's say mod_somemodule.xml
So the workorder is: Add files, fieldset and then the updateserver.

`<files>`
  `<folder>assets</folder>`
`</files>`

`<config>`
  `<fields name="params">`
    `<fieldset name="basic" addfieldpath="/modules/mod_somemodule/assets/fields">`
      `<field`
      `name="dlid"`
      `type="downloadid"`
      `label="Download ID"`
      `description="Download ID description"`
      `default=""`
      `extension="Some Module"`
      `key="dlid"`
      `/>`
    `</fieldset>`
  `</fields>`
`</config>`

`<updateservers>`
  `<server type="extension" name="Some Module" priority="1">http://www.yourwebsite.com/somemodule_update.xml</server>`
`</updateservers>`

Important

The Download ID field has two important additional attributes, _**extension**_ and _**key**_ where:

_**extension**_: must be the same as the _name_ attribute of &lt;server&gt;, this is very important to set the update the correct record in the update\_sites table.

_**key**_: has a default value of "dlid" which is used with Akeeba Subs & Release System combination, of course you can give it any other value if needed with any other subs and release managers.
